# BetterRest

### 100DaysOfSwiftUI - Project 4

Finally, finally, got to train my own ML Model and I'm glad I did it in swift. Better Rest is an app that took in 10k rows of pre-filled data to train an ML Model that is used to predict sleeping time based on coffee in-take and number of hours the use wishes to sleep. ☕️
